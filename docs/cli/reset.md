# `carapace reset`

Reset local config/state (keeps the CLI installed).

```bash
carapace reset
carapace reset --dry-run
carapace reset --scope config --yes --non-interactive
carapace reset --scope config+creds+sessions --yes --non-interactive
carapace reset --scope full --yes --non-interactive
```

## Options

- `--scope <scope>`: `config`, `config+creds+sessions`, or `full`
- `--yes`: skip confirmation prompts
- `--non-interactive`: disable prompts; requires `--scope` and `--yes`
- `--dry-run`: print actions without removing files

## Scopes

| Scope                   | Removes                                                                     | Stops gateway first |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `config`                | config file only                                                            | no                  |
| `config+creds+sessions` | config file, OAuth/credentials dir, per-agent session directories           | yes                 |
| `full`                  | state dir (including the shared SQLite database) plus workspace directories | yes                 |

`config+creds+sessions` and `full` stop a running managed gateway service before deleting state.

## Notes

- Run `carapace backup create` first for a restorable snapshot before removing local state.
- Before removing the state directory, `full` requires exclusive state ownership. If an unmanaged or externally supervised Gateway is still running, reset refuses and asks you to stop it first.
- Workspace setup state and attestations are rows in the shared SQLite database, so `full` removes them with the state directory; there are no current attestation sidecar files to remove separately.
- Without `--scope`, `carapace reset` prompts interactively for the scope to remove.
- `--non-interactive` is only valid when both `--scope` and `--yes` are set.
- `config+creds+sessions` and `full` print `Next: carapace onboard --install-daemon` when done.
